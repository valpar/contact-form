# Building and Running the Solution

Follow these steps to build and run the solution:

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. You can verify this by running `node -v` in your terminal. This should display the version of Node.js installed on your machine.

## Steps

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/valpar/contact-form.git`.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Use the command `cd contact-form` to navigate into the project directory.

3. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all the project dependencies.

4. **Build the project**: Run `npm run build` to build the project. This will create a `dist` directory with the compiled code.

5. **Run the project**: Run `npm run preview` to start the project. This will start the project on a local development server, usually on `http://localhost:4173`.

Open your preferred web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4173` to view the application.
